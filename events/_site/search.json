For more information on ecological forecasting, watch the short video below or read Dietze et al. 2018 PNAS.\nAt this stage we are only gathering information of those interested in participating in, contributing to, or collaborating with the initiative. If that includes you, please fill in this Google Form. This information will only be used for Ecoforecast Africa planning activities and will not be shared with others or used for research purposes. Please note that form responses are not monitored, so if you have any queries please contact Jasper Slingsby directly.\nNote that Ecoforecast Africa may adopt a different model to other EFI chapters due to differences in the needs and resources of the region (see Slingsby et al. 2023 MEE). What model we adopt will be up for discussion. Also note that while we are kickstarting the initiative, we do not claim ownership and invite broad participation, diverse perspectives and suggestions for the best leadership model.\nThanks!\nJasper Slingsby1,2,3 and Glenn Moncrieff2,3\n1Biological Sciences, University of Cape Town\n2Fynbos Node, South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)\n3Centre for Statistics in Ecology, Environment and Conservation, University of Cape Town\n\nThe following 4 minute video will give you a glossy overview of what ecological forecasting is about:"

    "text": "The NRF-funded RReTool project focused on developing Rapid and Repeatable tools for monitoring and mitigating global change impacts on natural resources in South Africa, predominantly using remote sensing.\nRecent advances in the availability of regularly updated, high resolution remotely-sensed data, combined with advances in computation have made it possible to monitor ecosystems at higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. Much of the focus in research and the development of tools to make use of this new data has been in the forested ecosystems of the northern hemisphere and the tropics. More than 90% of South Africa’s terrestrial surface is covered by “open” non-forest ecosystems such as shrublands, woodlands and grasslands. Detecting abnormal change in these ecosystems is highly challenging, because the state of the vegetation varies dramatically due to natural disturbances, long-term trends or cyclical functions, such as those relating to fire, postfire recovery, and seasonality. Overcoming these challenges is critical, because open ecosystems dominate much of the globe, making up >40% of the global total ecosystem organic carbon and harbour a substantial proportion of the world’s biological diversity.\nWith the National Research Foundation funded RReTool project, we are developing tools to make full use of the potential of satellite data for monitoring the non-forests ecosystems that dominate South Africa, and to deepen our understanding of how they vary in space and time. Using this information we are improving our ability to manage and mitigate the impacts of threats such as invasive alien plants, land cover transformation and climatic change. All of this is being achieved using only freely available open source software, and publicly available data, and reproducible research principles. The information and tools generated will therefore be available at no expense to researchers and managers to use and modify as needed, allowing outputs to be regularly updated and/or improved. This will ensure that environmental resource management is informed by up-to-date accurate data."

Collaboration within MedECIN will consist of (inter alia): horizon scanning, conceptual development of research questions, standardising data collection protocols, field data collection, and open-access sharing of data and code. Combining and comparing long-term vegetation datasets will support cross-site and multi-member network research, while also guiding creation of new datasets. Our approach is focused on (but not limited to) early career researchers with a focus on MTEs, to foster education and training of a new generation of researchers.\nFor more details, contact Jasper or Hana."

Participants will be introduced to how to develop, evaluate, improve and communicate ecological forecasts, with an emphasis on practical applications in conservation and resource management. Topics include Bayesian statistics (simple models, hierarchical Bayes, state-space models, etc); fusing multiple data sources; forecast uncertainty propagation & assessment; iterative data assimilation (e.g. Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter, Particle Filter); machine learning; decision science; and a range of ecological forecasting applications such as phenology, microbiomes, carbon, infectious disease, and aquatic productivity.\nThe course will be led by EFI founder Prof Michael Dietze (Boston University), supported by members of the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment and Conservation (SEEC) at the University of Cape Town, and others.\nThe course content will be based on previous courses run by the EFI, including the 2022 course. Further details will be shared here in due course."
